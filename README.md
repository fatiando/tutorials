# Fatiando a Terra tutorials

Jupyter notebooks with tutorials for using Fatiando a Terra software to solve
data problems in geoscience.

## Run the tutorials online

The easiest way to run the code in our tutorials is through the 
excellent [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service.
Click on the badge below and Binder will open up a JupyterLab instance on their
servers with the tutorial code.
Easy as that!

> **WARNING:** Binder will not save any changes you make and may shutdown your
> JupyterLab without warning. This is a good way to explore but if you intend
> on editing the notebook then we recommend running things on your machine.

## View the notebooks

You can also browse the code and text in the notebooks online (but won't be
able to run the code).
To do so, click on any of the `.ipynb` files in this GitHub repository.
Alternatively, the [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/fatiando/tutorials/tree/main/) 
version can be better and more reliable.
