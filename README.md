## "Stable" tutorials

These tutorials require that you have the very latest stable development version of Fatiando

To update your install, run:

    pip install --upgrade https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/archive/master.zip

## Development tutorials 

* [Interactive modeling for gravity and magnetics](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/tutorials/blob/master/Interactive_gravmag_modeling.ipynb)
* [Finite-difference seismic wave simulations](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/tutorials/blob/master/Simulating_seismic_waves.ipynb)
* [Working with data in grids and making maps](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/fatiando/tutorials/blob/master/Working_with_grids_and_making_maps.ipynb)

These tutorials are for features that are currently in development.
These will use code that is still in [pull requests](https://github.com/fatiando/fatiando/pulls).
To install the version of Fatiando, run:

    pip install --upgrade https://github.com/OWNER/fatiando/archive/BRANCH.zip

**Beware**: code in Pull Requests might not always work and should be used with caution! 
Things may, and probably will, change a lot during the development of a PR.
The notebooks might not work with the very latest commit.

As PRs get merged, these tutorials will be moved to the "stable" collection.
