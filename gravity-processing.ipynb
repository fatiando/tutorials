    "The **Bushveld Igneous Complex** is located in South Africa and is the largest known layered igneous intrusion. It has been tilted and eroded forming the outcrops around what appears to be the edge of a great geological basin: the Transvaal Basin. It is approximately 2 billion years old and is divided into four different limbs: the northern, southern, eastern, and western limbs. The Bushveld Complex comprises the Rustenburg Layered suite, the Lebowa Granites and the Rooiberg Felsics, that are overlain by the Karoo sediments. See [Webb et al. (2004)](https://doi.org/10.2113/107.1-2.207) for an overview and previous interpretations of the Bushveld in depth.\n",

    "> **Note:** There is an extra effect of under- and over-correcting for ocean water in the oceans. This happens because we are assuming that the surface of the water is at 0 geometric height (the surface of the ellipsoid) when in fact it roughly follows the geoid. So in oceanic places where the geoid is below the ellipsoid, we correct for water where there was none and vice-versa. Luckily, this effect is negligible here since our study area is relatively far away from the ocean. We can safely ignore this correction but it should be performed when close to the coast or directly above the oceans."
